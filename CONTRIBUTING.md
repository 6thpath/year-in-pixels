# Contributing to Year In Pixels

Our main responsibility is to be up to date with used technologies, keep core features of Year-In-Pixels and don't add tailored ones for specific users.

All efforts to contribute are highly appreciated, we recommend you talk to a maintainer prior to spending a lot of time making a pull request that may not align with the project roadmap.

## Submitting a Pull Request

Good pull requests, such as patches, improvements, and new features, are a fantastic help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits.

Please ask first if somebody else is already working on this or the core developers think your feature is in-scope for Year-In-Pixels. Generally always have a related issue with discussions for whatever you are including.

## Development Workflow

1. Clone the repo with git clone `https://github.com/lPaths/year-in-pixels.git`
